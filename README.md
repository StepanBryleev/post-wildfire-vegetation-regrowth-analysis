# Post-wildfire vegetation regrowth analysis
This is an [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/) Certificate project by Stepan Bryleev studying post-wildfire vegetation regrowth dynamics and is a continuation of the [Post-Wildfire recovery](https://github.com/AreteY/post-wildfire-recovery) project by [Heidi Yun](https://github.com/AreteY).

## Project goal 
In this project, we explore the post-wildfire vegetation regrowth dynamics for the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire perimeter by using Landsat, NEON LiDAR and NEON hyperspectral reflectance data. All analysis for NEON and Landsat data is performed in a GEE. So our second goal is to create a tutorial for NEON's website which can help earth scientists to understand the fundamentals of using GEE when working with NEON reflectance data for studying wildfires.

## GEE project page
To run project workflow use this link:


## Data
1. **NEON Imaging Spectrometer** reflectance data
2. **Landsat 8 / Sentinel** surface reflectance data

## Run the workflow
### Google Earth Engine
First, visit [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) official web-page to learn more about GEE and GEE Code Editor. GEE Code Editor is a web-based IDE for the Earth Engine JavaScript API. This repository includes .ipynb files containg JS code for analysing and plotting reflectance data. You can find these files in the **notebooks** folder.

### Python environment
To run Python files you need to have python environment installed on your computer. To learn how to install a conda environment from a .yml file that contains a list of desired Python packages visit [this page](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-python-conda-earth-analytics-environment/).

### Project Workflow
**Attention!** Project workflow is subject to update. To see a proposal section and preliminary results clone this repository and run the *vegetation_regrowth_analysis_blog.ipynb* notebook.
