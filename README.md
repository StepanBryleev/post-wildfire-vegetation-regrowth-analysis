# Post-wildfire vegetation regrowth analysis
This is an Earth Lab Certificate project by Stepan Bryleev studying post-wildfire vegetation regrowth dynamics.

## Project goal 
In this project, we explore the post-wildfire vegetation regrowth dynamics for the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire perimeter by using hyperspectral reflectance data. Because we use the most recent data, this project is a good contribution to environmental science data community. All analysis is performed in a GEE. So it can help beginner researchers to understand the fundamentals of using GEE for studying wildfires when working with reflectance data. It can also be useful for next groups of EarthLab students in the coming years.

## Data
1. NEON Imaging Spectrometer Reflectance data
2. Landsat 8 / Sentinel Surface Reflectance data

## Run the workflow
### Google Earth Engine
First, visit [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) official web-page to learn more about GEE and GEE Code Editor. GEE Code Editor is a web-based IDE for the Earth Engine JavaScript API. This repository includes .ipynb files containg JS code for analysing and plotting reflectance data. You can find these files in the **notebooks** folder.

### Python environment
To run Python files you need to have python environment installed on your computer. To learn how to install a conda environment from a .yml file that contains a list of desired Python packages visit [this page](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-python-conda-earth-analytics-environment/).

### Project Workflow
**Attention!** Project workflow is subject to update. To see a proposal section and preliminary results clone this repository and run the *vegetation_regrowth_analysis_blog.ipynb* notebook.
