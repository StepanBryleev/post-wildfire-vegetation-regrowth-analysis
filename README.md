# Post-wildfire vegetation regrowth analysis
This is an Earth Lab Certificate project by Stepan Bryleev studying post-wildfire vegetation regrowth dynamics.

## Project goal 
In this project, we explore the post-wildfire vegetation regrowth dynamics for the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire perimeter by using hyperspectral reflectance data.

## Data
1. NEON Imaging Spectrometer Reflectance data
2. Landsat 8 / Sentinel Surface Reflectance data

# Project Workflow
Project workflow is subject to update. To see a proposal section and preliminary results clone this repository and run the *vegetation_regrowth_analysis_blog.ipynb* notebook wth the *reflectance.py* module.

**Warning!** For running the .ipynb file on your computer assign the correct file path to your working and data directories!
